\section{Requirements}
The program would be expected to satisfy the following minimal requirements
in order for it to be considered successful: 
\begin{description}
\item [{Accuracy}]  -- any information produced by the parser should be reflective of the input e-mail
\item [{Representation}] -- the produced visualisation should be intuitive to read: each element should be presented separately from the others, and clearly labelled. 
\item [{Portability}] -- the visual output produced by the program should be available to the user in a variety of formats. 
\item [{Interactivity}] the program should produce sensible warnings when
an e-mail that is not possible to parse has been entered. 
\end{description}
