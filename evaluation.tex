\section{Future Work}

During the late stages of development and testing, a number of missing features quickly became apparent. Due to the limited information available, and the differences in version numbering, a decision was made to search for all available vulnerabilities for an application, allowing the user to discern which were most relevant.  Subsequent versions could focus on the different pieces of version data available.  For example, \texttt{esmtp} frequently references its version number in the ``Received'' field frequently.

Alternatively, a better picture may be presented by accumulating multiple e-mails. For example, using the information provided from multiple members of single organisation, a better picture may be built up of the software used by the servers, as well as the network configuration.
